/// A translated Metal shader: MSL source text plus the reflection data the Metal
/// backend needs to bind it. Buffer argument indices follow the translation
/// contract documented on <see cref="Gen5MslTranslator"/>: global memory buffers
/// occupy [[buffer(globalBufferBase + i)]] in <see cref="GlobalMemoryBindings"/>
/// order, and compute shaders reserve one trailing slot for the dispatch-limit
/// uniform. Unlike SPIR-V, Metal fixes the threadgroup size at dispatch time, so
/// the size the shader was translated for is carried here.

/// <remarks>
/// <para><see cref="UniformsBufferIndex"/> is the [[buffer(N)]] slot this stage's
/// SharpEmuUniforms argument was emitted at (globalBufferBase +
/// totalGlobalBufferCount, both translation-time inputs). Stages sharing a draw
/// can disagree — a vertex stage whose guest buffers sit after the pixel
/// stage's has a higher base — so the presenter must bind the uniforms buffer
/// per stage at this exact index rather than assuming one shared slot.</para>
/// <para>Texture slots are global across a draw's stages ([[texture(
/// ImageBindingBase + i)]]), but sampler slots are per-stage and compact:
/// Metal exposes only 16 sampler slots per stage against 31 texture slots, so
/// samplers count sampled (non-storage) images from zero within each stage.
/// <see cref="SamplerSlots"/> maps this stage's image binding index to its
/// [[sampler(N)]] slot, -1 for storage images that take none.</para>
