# SharpEmu: environment variables that are not on the GUI options pages

## Scope

This list contains each `SHARPEMU_*` environment variable in the repository that the GUI does not show.
The GUI shows 14 variables on its **Options** and **Game options** pages. This list does not contain them:
`SHARPEMU_BTHID_UNAVAILABLE`, `SHARPEMU_CRASH_CAPTURE`, `SHARPEMU_DEFAULT_PROFILE`,
`SHARPEMU_DISABLE_IMPORT_LOOP_GUARD`, `SHARPEMU_DUMP_SPIRV`, `SHARPEMU_LOG_DIRECT_MEMORY`, `SHARPEMU_LOG_IO`,
`SHARPEMU_LOG_NP`, `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE`, `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE_FRAME_TRACE`,
`SHARPEMU_RENDERDOC`, `SHARPEMU_VK_DISABLE_IMPLICITS`, `SHARPEMU_STRICT_COMPUTE`, `SHARPEMU_VK_VALIDATION`, `SHARPEMU_WRITABLE_APP0`.

The list contains 252 variables. The source was examined on 2026-09-19, branch `dev`.
The descriptions come from the code that reads each variable. The emulator was not started for this list.

## How to use a variable

1. Set the variable in the shell before you start the emulator or the GUI.
2. You can also enter additional env vars using the button next to the "Play" button from GUI.
3. The GUI also accepts a variable in the `EnvironmentToggles` list of its settings file. Write `NAME` or `NAME=value`. An entry without a value gets the value `1`.
4. The emulator reads most variables one time, when it starts. Start the game again after a change.
5. If the **Value** column shows `1`, only the value `1` turns the function on, unless the row gives other values.

## Behavior switches

These variables change how the emulator operates.

| Variable | Value | Function | Code that reads it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHARPEMU_AGC_VERSION13_DEFAULTS` | text (`legacy`, `generic` or `0`) | Selects the register defaults for AGC version 13 requests. The default uses the version 11 compact tables. The values `legacy`, `generic` and `0` use the older generic layout. | `AgcExports.Init.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DISABLE_LLE_LIBC` | `1` | Stops the use of the guest libc module for libc exports. The emulator then uses its HLE handlers for these exports. | `DirectExecutionBackend.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_HLE_FAST_MEMCPY` | `0` | Set to `0` to stop the native fast-path stub for the guest libc `memcpy` and `memmove`, so those imports use the managed HLE gateway again. | `DirectExecutionBackend.FastPath.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_HLE_FAST_PATH` | `0` | Set to `0` to stop the native fast-path stubs for `pthread_self` and `pthread_getspecific`, so those imports use the managed HLE gateway again. The stubs are on by default on macOS x64 and are off on any run that traces imports or pthreads. | `DirectExecutionBackend.FastPath.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_HOLD_FIRST_FLIP_MS` | number | Stops the thread that submits the flip for this number of milliseconds on one guest flip. The range is 0 to 60000 and the default is 0 (off). `SHARPEMU_HOLD_FLIP_NUMBER` selects the flip. | `VideoOutExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_HOLD_FLIP_NUMBER` | number | Selects the guest flip that `SHARPEMU_HOLD_FIRST_FLIP_MS` holds. The minimum is 1 and the default is 1 (the first flip). | `VideoOutExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_IGNORE_GUEST_EXCEPTIONS` | `1` | `sceKernelRaiseException` returns OK and does not call the installed guest exception handler. Default is off. | `KernelExceptionCompatExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_IMPORT_LOOP_GUARD_SECONDS` | number | Sets the time that an import call pattern can repeat before the import loop guard forces a guest exit. The default is 5 seconds. The value 0 turns the guard off. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Imports.cs`, `DirectExecutionBackend.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_NET_REDIRECT` | IP address | Sends guest `connect` and `sendto` traffic to this host IP address. When unset, the emulator permits outbound guest traffic only to loopback addresses. If the value is not a valid IP address, the emulator keeps the original destination and permits the traffic. | `KernelSocketCompatExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_NO_FLIP_PACING` | `1` | Stops flip pacing. The emulator completes each flip immediately and does not wait for the display refresh time. The default is off. | `VideoOutExports.cs`, `VideoOutExports.FlipRequests.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_OVERLAY` | `0` | Hides the performance overlay at start, even when the video options have the overlay on. All other values use the video options. | `PerfOverlay.cs`, `PerformanceOverlayState.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_POSIX_GPU_FAULT_FAST_PATH` | `0` | Set to `0` to stop the POSIX fault bridge from offering GPU-tracked page faults to the GPU memory tracker before it builds the Win64 exception context. The fault then takes the full handler order again. | `DirectExecutionBackend.PosixSignals.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_RETAIN_SUBMITTED_INDEX_DATA` | `0` | The default is on. The emulator keeps a copy of submitted index data until the translated draws run. Set to `0` to stop this copy. Use `0` only for a comparison test. | `AgcExports.SubmittedGeometry.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_RETAIN_SUBMITTED_VERTEX_DATA` | `0` | The default is on. The emulator keeps a copy of submitted vertex data until the translated draws run. Set to `0` to stop this copy. Use `0` only for a comparison test. | `AgcExports.SubmittedGeometry.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_SAVEDATA_DIR` | path | Set the root directory for save data. The default is `user/savedata` next to the executable. When this variable is set, the emulator does not move save data from the old layout. | `SaveDataStorage.cs`, `SaveDataExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_STALL_WATCHDOG_SECONDS` | number (seconds) | Sets the time without import progress before the stall watchdog operates. The default is 20. The watchdog writes a snapshot and stops the process with exit code 4. It does not operate when a guest thread is ready or a known wait is in progress. `0` stops the watchdog. | `DirectExecutionBackend.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_STRICT_RWLOCK_WRITER_PREFERENCE` | `1` | Set to `1` to make a guest thread take a free pthread rwlock as the exclusive writer. By default, the thread gets a compatibility writer record and the lock has no writer thread. | `KernelPthreadExtendedCompatExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_TEMP0_DIR` | path | Set the host directory for the guest `temp0` mount. The default is `user/temp/<app name>/temp0` next to the executable. When unset, the kernel code sets this variable to the default path. | `AppContentExports.cs`, `KernelMemoryCompatExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_TRACE_TITLE_SHADER_STATE` | `1` | The SPIR-V translator changes the pixel shader at address 0x0000000500781200 for diagnosis. The first float output then shows the execution state, the wave mask state, and the export state as colors. Default is off. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |

## GPU and Vulkan

These variables change the GPU path or the Vulkan presenter.

| Variable | Value | Function | Code that reads it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_EXEC_PCS` | list (`pc:register` pairs) | At each given instruction PC, the pixel shader writes the execution flag to the given VGPR register. The value is 1.0 when the flag is set and 0.0 when it is not. `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_VGPR_ADDRESS` must match the shader address. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_IMAGE_ADDRESS` | hex address | Selects the pixel shader for the image capture by its program address. The default is no capture. Use it with `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_IMAGE_PC`. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |

| `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_VGPR_POINTS` | list (`pc:source:destination` triples) | At each given instruction PC, the pixel shader copies the source VGPR register to the destination register. Register numbers must be less than 256. `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_VGPR_ADDRESS` must match the shader address. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_VGPR_SOURCES` | list (one to four register numbers) | Gives the source VGPR registers that the translator copies at `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_VGPR_PC`. The copies go to the registers that start at the destination base. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DETILE` | `1` or `0` | Controls the detile step for tiled surfaces. The default detiles only the trusted swizzle modes. `1` also detiles the approximate modes and `0` uploads all surfaces as raw data. | `GnmTiling.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DISABLE_FILL_CLEAR` | `1` | Stops the adaptation that treats a transparent premultiplied fill draw as a target overwrite. The default keeps the adaptation on. | `ShaderPipelineCache.Adaptations.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_ENABLE_CHUNKED_DRAWS` | `1` | The Vulkan presenter reads the value into a field. No code uses the field, so the variable has no effect. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Draws.Recording.cs` |

| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PACKED_EXPORT_STORE_ONE` | `1` | The SPIR-V translator writes (1.0, 1.0) to the packed half-float pair before the export reads it. This applies only to the pixel shader at guest address 0x0000000500781200. Default is off. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PACKED_STORE_EXEC_VALUES` | `1` | Each packed half-float store writes 1.0 when the EXEC mask is active and 0.5 when it is not. This shows the EXEC state as a color. This applies only to the pixel shader at guest address 0x0000000500781200. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PIXEL_EXPORT_ADDRESS` | hex address | Sets the shader address filter for the pixel export debug overrides. The value is a hex address, and the `0x` prefix is optional. When unset, the overrides apply to all pixel shaders. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PIXEL_EXPORT_PACK_VGPR_BASE` | number | Float pixel outputs read four vector registers that start at this base plus four times the export target. The translator packs the values to half-float and unpacks them again. The address filters select the shaders. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PIXEL_EXPORT_VGPR_ADDRESS` | hex address | Sets the shader address filter for the two VGPR base overrides. The `0x` prefix is optional. When unset, the filter from `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PIXEL_EXPORT_ADDRESS` applies. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PIXEL_EXPORT_VGPR_BASE` | number | Float pixel outputs read four vector registers that start at this base plus four times the export target. These values replace the decoded export sources. The address filters select the shaders. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PIXEL_MAGENTA` | `1` | Each selected pixel shader export writes opaque magenta. The control flow, EXEC mask, geometry and raster state stay the same. Use `SHARPEMU_FORCE_PIXEL_EXPORT_ADDRESS` to select one shader. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_SOLID_FRAGMENT` | `1` | The Vulkan presenter reads the value into a field. No code uses the field, so the variable has no effect at this time. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Draws.Recording.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_COMPARE_4D4` | `1` | The compare instruction at shader PC 0x4D4 always gives the result true. This applies only to the shader at guest address 0x0000000500781200. Default is off. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.Alu.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_COMPARE_540` | `1` | The compare instruction at shader PC 0x540 always gives the result true. This applies only to the shader at guest address 0x0000000500781200. Default is off. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.Alu.cs` |

| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_EARLY_COLOR` | `1` | The pixel shader at guest address 0x0000000500781200 writes a constant to its first output and returns at once. A float output gets opaque magenta. An integer output gets zero. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_EXPORT_EXEC` | `1` | The translator sets the EXEC mask to true and writes 1 to 64-bit register 126 before each pixel export store. This applies only to the pixel shader at guest address 0x0000000500781200. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_FULLSCREEN_VERTEX` | `1` | The Vulkan presenter reads the value into a field. No code uses the field, so the variable has no effect at this time. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Draws.Recording.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_SINGLE_MRT` | `1` | The translator declares only the first pixel output for the pixel shader at guest address 0x0000000500781200. It does not declare the other render target outputs. Default is off. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_SOLID_FRAGMENT` | `1` | The Vulkan presenter reads the value into a field. No code uses the field, so the variable has no effect at this time. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Draws.Recording.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_FORCE_TITLE_VERTEX_OUTPUTS_ONE` | `1` | Vertex export targets 32 to 35 write the vector (1, 1, 1, 1). This applies only to the vertex shader at guest address 0x0000000500780000. Default is off. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_GPU_BACKEND` | `vulkan` or `metal` | Selects the guest GPU backend. The default is Vulkan. The value `metal` works only on macOS, and other hosts show a warning and use Vulkan. | `GuestGpu.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_GRAPHICS_SUBGROUPS` | `0` or `1` | Set `1` to use native Vulkan subgroup operations in graphics shaders. Set `0` to use the fallback path. When unset, the presenter uses them only if the subgroup size is 32 and the vertex and fragment stages support subgroups. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.cs`, `VulkanVideoPresenter.Device.Setup.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_MARK_PIXEL_PCS` | list of `pc:register` pairs | Makes the SPIR-V pixel shader write the float value 1.0 to a shader register when execution reaches the given instruction PC. Use decimal numbers, a register below 256, and a comma between pairs. It has an effect only for the shader address in `SHARPEMU_CAPTURE_PIXEL_VGPR_ADDRESS`. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_MAX_GUEST_WORK_PER_RENDER` | number | Sets the maximum number of guest command stream slices that the Vulkan presenter runs in one render pass. The default is 1024, or 256 on macOS. The value must be more than 0. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.cs`, `VulkanVideoPresenter.CommandStream.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_RENDERDOC_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | number (seconds) | Set the maximum time for a RenderDoc frame capture. The emulator discards a capture that does not end in this time. The range is 1 to 120. The default is 15. | `RenderDocCapture.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_RENDERDOC_DLL` | path | Set the path of the RenderDoc library file. The emulator tries this path first. When unset or when the load fails, it searches the default library name and the known install paths. | `RenderDocCapture.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_RENDERDOC_WAIT` | number (seconds) or `enter` | Set to make the emulator wait before it starts Vulkan, so that you can attach RenderDoc. `enter` waits until you press Enter.

| `SHARPEMU_SKIP_TALL_COMPUTE_Z` | number | Effect not clear from the code. The Vulkan presenter reads the number into a field for a minimum Z group count. No code uses that field. The default is 0. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_VK_DEBUG_LABELS` | `1` | Turns on Vulkan object names and command labels for capture tools. `SHARPEMU_VK_VALIDATION=1` also turns them on. Default is off because the labels add overhead to each draw. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Draws.Recording.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_VK_DEVICE` | text (part of a device name) | Selects the Vulkan device whose name contains this text. The comparison ignores case. When unset, the presenter gives a score to each device and prefers a discrete GPU. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Device.Setup.cs`, `VulkanVideoPresenter.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_VK_PIPELINE_CACHE_PATH` | path | Sets the path of the Vulkan pipeline cache file. The path can contain environment variables. Default is `user/pipeline_cache/<title id>/` below the application directory. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Device.Setup.cs`, `VulkanPipelineCacheStorage.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_VK_PIPELINE_CACHE` | `0` | `0` stops the save and the load of the Vulkan pipeline cache file. The cache then stays in memory only. Default is a persistent cache file. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Device.Setup.cs` |

## Metal

These variables apply to the Metal backend.

| Variable | Value | Function | Code that reads it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHARPEMU_GPU_DETILE` | `0` | The Metal backend decodes supported tiled texture data on the GPU by default. Set `0` to decode all tiled textures on the CPU. | `MetalTextureSnapshots.cs`, `GuestGpuTypes.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_LOG_GPU_DETILE` | `1` | Writes each texture tile mode and each GPU detile decision one time to stderr. It applies to the Metal texture path only. The emulator reads the value one time at start. | `MetalTextureSnapshots.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_METAL_CAP_DRAWABLE` | `1` | Limits the long edge of the Metal drawable to 1920 pixels and keeps the aspect ratio. The default is off, so the drawable uses the full window pixel size. | `MetalVideoPresenter.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_METAL_DBG` | `solid` or `uv` | Replaces the Metal present fragment shader with a test shader. `solid` shows a green frame. `uv` shows the value of vertex attribute 0. All other values use the normal present shader. | `MetalVideoPresenter.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_METAL_FULL_DRAWABLE` | `1` | Cancels `SHARPEMU_METAL_CAP_DRAWABLE=1`, so the Metal drawable uses the full window pixel size. It has no effect when the cap is off. | `MetalVideoPresenter.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_NO_TEXTURE_SKIP` | `1` | Stops the reuse of cached texture snapshots in the Metal backend, so each texture is copied again. Use it to make sure that a snapshot is not stale. The default is off. | `MetalTextureSnapshots.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_REUSE_GUEST_TEXTURE_SNAPSHOTS` | `0` | The default is on. The Metal backend uses a guest texture snapshot again when the snapshot key is the same. Set to `0` to make a new snapshot each time. | `MetalTextureSnapshots.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_TEXTURE_DUMP_DIR` | path | Set a directory to make the Metal backend write raw texture source bytes to `.bin` files. The file name contains the address, size, pitch, format and tile mode. The limit is 200 files. | `MetalTextureSnapshots.cs` |

| `SHARPEMU_AUDIO_LATENCY_MS` | number (milliseconds) | Sets the target depth of the SDL audio queue, which is the playback latency. The default is 60. Values of zero or less use the default. | `SdlHostAudio.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_BINK_MODE` | text (`native`, `ffmpeg`, `dummy`, `skip`, `guest`) | Selects how the emulator handles Bink movies. `native` or `ffmpeg` decodes on the host and is the default. `dummy` shows a placeholder frame, `skip` skips the movie, and `guest` lets the guest decode. | `HostMovieBridge.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_LOG_MOVIE_SYNC` | `1` | Records the difference between the movie clock and the guest audio position during movie playback. The emulator reads the value one time at start. | `MediaFramePlayback.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_MOVIE_CLOCK` | `wall` | Sets the time base for host-decoded movie playback. By default, playback follows the guest audio clock and uses the wall clock when no guest audio flows. `wall` makes playback always use the wall clock. | `MediaFramePlayback.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_TRACE_AVPLAYER_IMAGES` | `1` | Set to `1` to write `[AVPLAYER][TRACE]` lines for video buffer addresses and the first 16 video frame payloads. It also marks the video buffer ranges for image traces in other components. The default is off. | `AvPlayerExports.cs` |

## Input

These variables apply to the controller and input libraries.

| `SHARPEMU_BTHID_CB_FAIL` | text (`nf` or `ni`) | Makes `sceBluetoothHidRegisterCallback` return an error. `nf` returns NOT_FOUND and `ni` returns NOT_IMPLEMENTED. The default returns the usual result. | `BluetoothHidExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_BTHID_EVENT_CODE` | number (decimal or `0x` hex) | Sets the event code of the synthetic Bluetooth HID callback event. The default is 0. It has an effect only with `SHARPEMU_BTHID_FIRE_CALLBACK=1`. | `BluetoothHidExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_BTHID_EVENT_SIZE` | number (bytes, decimal or `0x` hex) | Sets the size of the zeroed event structure for the synthetic Bluetooth HID callback. The default is 256. It has an effect only with `SHARPEMU_BTHID_FIRE_CALLBACK=1`. | `BluetoothHidExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_BTHID_FIRE_CALLBACK` | `1` | Calls the registered Bluetooth HID guest callback one time with a zeroed event structure. The call occurs at the first `sceBluetoothHidRegisterDevice`. The default is off. | `BluetoothHidExports.cs` |

## Memory and CPU

These variables apply to guest memory and guest code execution.

| Variable | Value | Function | Code that reads it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHARPEMU_DISABLE_GUEST_ALLOCATOR_HOLE_RECOVERY` | `1` | Stops the Windows fault recovery for a guest allocator that reads an empty pool node. The default recovers the fault and continues at the allocator fallback code. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Exceptions.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DISABLE_MITIGATION_RELAUNCH` | `1` | Stops the Windows relaunch of the emulator as a child process with Control Flow Guard and CET shadow stacks off. The default starts the child process. | `Program.cs`, `SelfLoader.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DISABLE_NATIVE_GUEST_WORKERS` | `1` | Stops the use of native worker threads for guest thread execution on Windows. The default uses the native workers. | `DirectExecutionBackend.NativeWorker.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DISABLE_POSIX_SIGNALS` | `1` | Does not install the POSIX signal handlers on Linux and macOS. The emulator then cannot recover guest faults. | `DirectExecutionBackend.PosixSignals.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DISABLE_RAW_HANDLER` | `1` | Does not install the raw vectored exception handler on Windows. On POSIX hosts it stops the raw sentinel recovery. The default keeps the two functions on. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Exceptions.cs`, `DirectExecutionBackend.PosixSignals.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_IGNORE_INT41` | `0` or `false` | The fault handler skips guest `int 0x41` instructions and continues at the next instruction by default. Set `0` or `false` to stop this recovery. The emulator shows a warning for the first 16 traps and then for each 65536th trap. | `DirectExecutionBackend.cs`, `DirectExecutionBackend.Exceptions.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_IGNORE_STACK_CHK` | `1` | Recovers from a guest stack-protector failure call (NID `Ou3iL1abvng`) when a UD2 instruction follows the call. The emulator sets the return address to the function epilogue 20 bytes before. It does this only when the code bytes match the known pattern. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Imports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_LAZY_RESERVE_PRIME_MB` | number | Sets the number of megabytes that the emulator commits at the start of each reserve-only memory region. The default is 64 and the maximum is 4096. The value 0 turns the initial commit off. | `PhysicalVirtualMemory.cs` |

| `SHARPEMU_TRACE_TITLE_INTERFACE` | `1` | The SPIR-V translator writes `[AGC][TITLE-INTERFACE]` lines with the export and interpolation instructions of a shader. It does this only for the programs at addresses 0x0000000500780000 and 0x0000000500781200. | `Gen5SpirvTranslator.cs` |

## Data dumps

Each variable writes data to files.

| Variable | Value | Function | Code that reads it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHARPEMU_DUMP_FAULT_STACK_WINDOW` | `1` | Writes the full stack window from RSP-0x300 to RSP+0x100 to the error output when a guest fault report occurs. The default writes only the short stack list. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Exceptions.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DUMP_FIXED_SOLID_FRAGMENT` | path | The Vulkan presenter reads the value into a field. No code uses the field, so the variable has no effect. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Draws.Recording.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DUMP_SPIRV_ADDRESS` | hex address | Limits the shader dump of `SHARPEMU_DUMP_SPIRV=1` to the shader at this guest address. The default writes all shaders. | `ShaderProgramCache.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_DUMP_VIDEOOUT` | `1` | Writes submitted VideoOut frame buffers as BMP files with a text metadata file. It writes a maximum of 8 frames and skips a frame that did not change. | `VideoOutExports.cs`, `VideoOutExports.FlipRequests.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_GUEST_IMAGE_DUMP_CONTINUOUS` | `1` | Writes a swapchain dump for each presented frame, not only for the first one. It needs `SHARPEMU_GUEST_IMAGE_DUMP_DIR` and an active presented-image trace. Each dump waits for the GPU, so the frame rate decreases. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Present.Frames.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_GUEST_IMAGE_DUMP_DIR` | path | Sets the directory for raw swapchain dumps. The presenter writes `present-NNNN-WxH-format.bgra` files there when `SHARPEMU_TRACE_GUEST_IMAGES` is `1` or `present`. The presenter makes the directory if it is absent. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Present.Frames.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_LOG_DISASM_ADDRS` | list of hex addresses | Adds more addresses to the fault disassembly dump. Use a comma between the addresses. The emulator uses this list only when `SHARPEMU_LOG_DISASM` is `1`, and it shows 48 instructions for each address. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Exceptions.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_LOG_DISASM` | `1` | Writes guest disassembly to stderr when a guest fault, an abort or an illegal instruction occurs. It shows the code before the fault address, before the stack return address and before three frame return addresses. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Exceptions.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_LOG_IL2CPP_EXCEPTION` | `1` | Writes a diagnostic dump when the guest calls the unresolved import with NID `cfwBSQyr5Ys`. The dump shows the registers, the code pointers on the stack and the frame pointer chain. The emulator writes a maximum of 4 dumps. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Imports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_LOG_POINTER_WINDOWS` | list of hex addresses | Writes a memory window for each address when a guest access fault occurs. Use a comma between the addresses. The window size is 0x80 bytes unless `SHARPEMU_LOG_POINTER_WINDOW_SIZE` sets a different size. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Exceptions.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_SHADER_SPIRV_DUMP_DIR` | path | Set a directory for shader dumps. When set, the Vulkan presenter writes each SPIR-V module to a numbered `.spv` file. The `SHARPEMU_DUMP_SPIRV=1` dumps also use this directory. Their default is `shader-dumps` next to the executable. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Pipelines.cs`, `ShaderProgramCache.cs`, `VulkanVideoPresenter.Device.Setup.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_SWAPCHAIN_DUMP_EVERY` | number (frames) | Set a number N to trace the presented swapchain image at each Nth present. This operates only when `SHARPEMU_TRACE_GUEST_IMAGES` is `1` or `present`. The default is 0, which traces only the first presented image. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Present.Frames.cs`, `VulkanVideoPresenter.Draws.Recording.cs` |

## Performance measurement

Each variable records timings or counts.

| Variable | Value | Function | Code that reads it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SHARPEMU_LOG_AUDIO_QUEUE` | `1` | Writes one `[PERF][AUDIO]` line per second for each SDL audio stream. The line shows the queue depth in milliseconds, the submit rate, the fill percentage and the drops. The emulator reads the value one time at start. | `SdlHostAudio.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PERF_HLE_NODICT` | `1` | Use with `SHARPEMU_PERF_HLE=1`. Set to `1` to stop the call count dictionary and the top call count report. The dispatch time report stays on. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Diagnostics.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PERF_HLE` | `1` | Set to `1` to measure the time of each HLE import dispatch. After each 500000 calls, the emulator writes `[PERF][HLE]` lines with the call counts and the cost of the top exports. The default is off. | `DirectExecutionBackend.Diagnostics.cs`, `DirectExecutionBackend.Imports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PERF_MEM` | `1` | Set to `1` to count the POSIX fault signals that the signal handler receives. The emulator writes a `[PERF][MEM] posix_faults` line after each 100000 signals. This has an effect only on POSIX hosts. | `DirectExecutionBackend.PosixSignals.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_DCB_PARSE` | `1` | Set to `1` to measure the time to parse draw command buffers. The emulator writes `[PERF][DCB_PARSE]` lines. `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE=1` also starts this profile. | `DcbParseProfile.cs` |

| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_GUEST_RIP_INTERVAL_MS` | number (milliseconds) | Set the time between samples of the guest code profiler. The value must be more than 0. The default is 2. | `DirectExecutionBackend.GuestSampler.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_GUEST_RIP_REPORT_S` | number (seconds) | Set the time between reports of the guest code profiler. The value must be more than 0. The default is 15. | `DirectExecutionBackend.GuestSampler.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_GUEST_RIP_THREAD` | text | Set a text filter for the guest code profiler. The profiler samples only guest threads whose name contains this text. The comparison ignores case. When unset, the profiler samples all guest threads. | `DirectExecutionBackend.GuestSampler.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_GUEST_RIP` | `1` | Set to `1` to start a sample profiler for guest code. The profiler records the instruction address of each guest thread and writes `[PERF][GUEST]` reports. The default is off. | `DirectExecutionBackend.GuestSampler.cs`, `DirectExecutionBackend.Imports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_GUEST_SCHEDULER` | `1` | Set to `1` to record guest thread scheduler statistics. The emulator writes `[PERF][GUEST_SCHED]` lines. With `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE_FRAME_TRACE=1`, it also records guest thread flow events. `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE=1` also starts this profile. | `DirectExecutionBackend.GuestSchedulerProfile.cs`, `GuestThreadFlowProfile.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_RENDER_REPORT_S` | number (seconds) | Set the time between render profile reports. The value can be a decimal number and must be more than 0. The default is 5. | `RenderPhaseProfile.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_RENDER` | `1` | Set to `1` to measure the time of each render thread phase. The emulator writes `[PERF][RENDER]`, `[PERF][RENDER_MS]` and related lines. With `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE_FRAME_TRACE=1`, it also records GPU memory access counters. `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE=1` also starts this profile. | `RenderPhaseProfile.cs`, `GpuMemoryAccessProfile.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_GPU_COMMANDS` | `1` | Set to `1` to record GPU timestamp intervals around draws and dispatches, independently of CPU render profiling. Writes `[PERF][GPU_INTERVAL]` reports. Queries can perturb GPU scheduling; leave disabled for performance acceptance runs. | `VulkanVideoPresenter.Scheduler.cs`, `VulkanCommandProfile.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_SYNC_ON_ADDRESS` | `1` | Set to `1` to start the detailed sync-on-address profile. The emulator also records the guest call stack for each wait and wake call. It writes `[PERF][SYNC_ADDR]` and `[PERF][SYNC_THREAD]` lines. `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE=1` starts the profile without the call stack. | `KernelSyncOnAddressProfile.cs`, `KernelSyncOnAddressCompatExports.cs` |
| `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_TEXTURE_PREPARATION` | `1` | Set to `1` to measure texture preparation work. The emulator writes `[PERF][TEXTURE_PREP]` lines. `SHARPEMU_PROFILE_PERFORMANCE=1` also starts this profile. | `TexturePreparationProfile.cs` |
